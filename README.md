# GDSC_Git

This repository contains the code for my Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) session on Git and GitHub.
The goal of this session was to introduce the students to how git works and some of its basic and useful commands. This project was a simple means of illustration. It's goal was neither efficiency nor correctness--although it does work.

The session notes can be found [here](https://clover-gymnast-aeb.notion.site/GDSC-Git-Session-e7770631131d443b8c42fe4fa5edbcbe)
